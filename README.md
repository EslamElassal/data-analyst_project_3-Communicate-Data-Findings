# data-analyst_project_3-Communicate-Data-Findings
Share Data Discoveries - GoBikes

For the Data Analyst Nanodegree program offered by Udacity, this is the third of three projects finished. It is intended to be an exercise in data visualization and presentation for uni, bi, and multivariate data rather than a thorough examination of the dataset.

Data about Ford Go-Bike usage in the greater San Francisco area may be found in the aforementioned dataset.
Even though the visualisations are the main emphasis of this project, I cleaned and otherwise altered the data in order to create some intriguing data explorations.

The cleaning and exploring phase is covered in Part 1.

Only the last observations and a summary are included in Part 2, which is far shorter.
